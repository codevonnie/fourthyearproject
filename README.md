# Membership - Message Server Api

The following branch contains a Messaging Server developed using NodeJs.

It allows Clients(Web App) to connect to the server over Http using Server Side Events and wait for any outgoing messages from the server without polling.

Messages are sent to a route setup on the Api from The Mobile Application, which in turn are then sent out to connected Companies.
